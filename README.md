# Expresso

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

In order for the tests and provided front-end to run properly, you will need to make sure to:
- Create and export your Express app from a root-level file called **server.js**
- Accept and set an optional port argument for your server to listen on from `process.env.PORT`
- If `process.env.PORT` is not set, server should run on port `4000` (this is where the provided front-end will make requests to)
- Accept and set an optional database file argument from `process.env.TEST_DATABASE` in all Express route files that open and modify your database
- Use the root-level **database.sqlite** as your API's database
- **Note:** When loading **database.sqlite** in your JavaScript files, sqlite3 will always try to load **database.sqlite** from the root directory path, `./database.sqlite`, regardless of where the current file is located. Therefore your code will always be `new sqlite3.Database(process.env.TEST_DATABASE || './database.sqlite')` regardless of the file you are writing in

## Testing

A testing suite has been provided for you, checking for all essential functionality and
edge cases.

To run these tests, first, open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install
all necessary testing dependencies (if you haven't already).
Finally, run `npm test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information
about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output
about why each failing test failed.

As you implement functionality, run the tests to
ensure you are creating correctly named variables and functions that return the proper values.
The tests will additionally help you identify edge cases that you may not have anticipated
when first writing the functions.
